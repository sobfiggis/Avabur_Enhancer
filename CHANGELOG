**Update**  

**v0.9.1**

*   NEW! Drop tracker now contains Crafting section along with a platinum counter, moonlocket quest proc counter, quest item counter.
*   NEW! Quick sell features added to the market. Will sell all items corresponding to whichever page you're on at lowest market value -1.
*   NEW! Kills (based on current XP from current battle) until level counter added below exp/hour.
*   NEW! Quest timer added below the quest counter. Need to reset drop tracker if fatigued/starting item quest to calibrate properly, as it uses data from the drop tracker including quest item drop rate.
*   BUG FIX! Fixed issue with platinum counters from previous versions which wasn't counting platinum drops.

**v0.8**

*   NEW! Custom chat colors for individual players, with in game interface for assigning a color to a player. _This is for Main chat only and does not effect other channels colors_. Note: In case any of you have not been copying the script header info when you update the script, make sure you notice the _// @require_ line that is well… required.
*   UPDATED! Chat Swap feature will now expand the chat box height automatically when swapped in order to better fill the space.
*   UPDATED! New user option for XP/Gold/Resources per hour that allows you to set the size of the text. Also default size is now 12 which is slightly smaller than the normal info at 14.
*   BUG FIX! Hit & Crit Averages should now be correct in the battle tracker. Special thanks to Future for helping resolve the issue!
*   BUG FIX! Counter Attacks increases are now properly tracked when “Display brief drop messages” is enabled.

**v0.7**

*   NEW! Chat Location Swap added, look for it in the features section.
*   NEW! Quest Complete Helper added, look for it in the features section.
*   BUG FIX! Individual stats should now track in Drop Tracker even if “Display brief drop messages” is disabled in preferences.
*   BUG FIX! Crystal drops should now track properly on Harvests too (sorry TSers I forget you sometimes). Again, let me know if they don’t because it’s not easily tested.

**v0.6.1**

*   BUG FIX! All percentages on Drop Tracker now reset properly when you click reset. (apperently it’s not spelled precent)
*   BUG FIX! Crystal drops should now track properly. Let me know if they don’t because it’s not like I can easily test that one.

**v0.6**

*   NEW! Drop Tracker added. See below for description and screenshot.
*   UPDATED! Battle Tracker to include evasion. All enemy misses are sent under player dodges so no way to determing which role evasion, agility, or enemy coordination play in the total percentage.
*   UPDATED! Slightly new look for existing trackers with cleaner looking styles and a scroll bar for the Ingredient Tracker when the list gets too long.
*   KNOWN BUG! Had 1 report of crit average being lower than the lowest hit which is not possible. Still trying to figure it out but if someone has any ideas send them my way.

**v0.5.2**

*   Okay, so there was still a bug where it was not updating harvesting drops until you refresh the page. This is fixed, I’m kinda sorta almost certain…ish.

**v0.5.1**

*   Fixed bug in Ingredient Tracker for harvesting. I had changed the way it stored the data in testing but made the update only to battle drops. If you have used the tracker for harvesting and gotten a drop you will need to delete the variable from local storage. Do this by opening your browsers console (Chrome: _F12_, Firefox: _Ctrl + Shift + K_, IE: _use a better browser noob_, Others: _Google it_) type **localStorage.removeItem(“LocDrops”)** then enter.

**v0.5**

*   Renamed Script as this is no longer just a battle tracker. Accepting ideas on another new name if someone has a good one (PM me).
*   Added Ingredient Tracker to help fill out the list growing in another thread.
*   Added XP/Gold/Resources Per Hr
*   Added Real % reduction indicator on Quest Boost in the Crystal Shop
*   Added a User Options section to the script to turn disable certain features as you like.

**v0.4**

*   I moved things around for better organization as the script grows.
*   I added damage tracking min/max/avg the best I could with the information available.
*   I added counter attack tracking that somehow got left out previously.
*   Changed header colors.
*   Seems like more I might be forgetting.

**v0.3**

*   I made a small change to allow it to work on [avabur.com](https://avabur.com) AND [www.avabur.com](https://www.avabur.com)
*   The battle tracker is now a draggable resizable popup window that you can open by clicking Battle Stats)
*   The damage calcs have placeholder columns but are still not implemented. They will probably be in the next couple days.
*   I included my modification to the clan donation list tab that is pretty pointless for most people, but I don’t want to take the code out every time I update this post
