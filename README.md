###Instructions
Before using the Battle Tracker script make sure you go to Account Management -> Preferences -> and check the "Display battles round-by-round..." box. If not then the rounds don't get sent.

Also, you will need TamperMonkey for chrome, or GreaseMonkey for firefox. Although, I've only tested this in chrome so I'm just assuming GreaseMonkey works. You just create a new script and paste in the code below and save it. You can also disable certain features of this addon by setting them to false in the "User Options" section of the script before saving.

Lastly, as always, use custom scripts at your own risk! If you don't know how to program than you are trusting the programmer a lot.

#Features

####Chat & Battle Location Swap
This is a toggle that stays with you between sessions. It relocates the chat above the main battle/harvest area. In addition, the "Effects" and "House Notification" areas are moved to the bottom right section, they are still above "Recent Activity" but no longer force the lower section to be farther down the page when chat is swapped.

####Customizable Main Chat Colors Eor Each Player
This is a nice feature when not overused. You don't want too many colors flying around or they won't mean anything. Say I want Gandor to chat in a certain color so I can recognize it better. I'd do something like this...

####Quest Complete Helper
With this enabled, whenever you complete a battle or harvest and the quest is complete, all of the other sections of the screen fade until you complete the quest. Note the Screen fades 1 battle/harvest action after completing, and returns to normal 1 action after collecting the reward.

####Battle Tracker & XP/Gold/Resource Per Hour
Track certain battle stats in a session for your own curiosity. The per hour color can be changed in user options near the top of the script before you save it.

####Drop Tracker & Ingredient Tracker
The Drop Tracker keeps track of the frequency of drops in a session. It tracks categories (stat/loot/ingredient), then breaks them down by individual type of drop.
The Ingredient Tracker tracks the enemy or tool your ingredients came from. The data stays across session on the same computer. It was created primarily for this thread.

####Real % reduction on Quest Boost
This is just something small I added because I was curious what percentage of the quests were actually being removed based on Quest Boosts.
